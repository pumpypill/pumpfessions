1. Confessions 

# Below are examples of crypto confessions from the popular twitter page "coinfession"

* Quitting crypto healed me.

* I met a girl in 2021 who said she did crypto. She begged me to invest in CRO. It was around .80 cents at the time. I wanted to flex so I bought 106k worth. I ended up selling for 99k loss. The girl is now my wife.

* I have spent the last 7 years trying to make money on crypto. So far I have lost my house, my girlfriend and I spend all my monthly salary on it.

* I literally bought $1m of a Solana meme coin called useless at $400m market cap at the end of July. It's now at $150m. I thought it was going to billions. I'm down over $600k. In hindsight, I can't believe I thought a coin literally called useless would go to billions. 

* Put $200 into Troll coin a little over a year and a half ago.

* I made a million dollars at 19 in Jan 2024 in crypto, dropped out of college, went in full time, then lost it all. Hustled until Dec 2024 when I made another 2m, spent/lost most of it now. Currently more locked in than ever. The future is bright.

* My parents gave me $350k for a house and I lost it all gambling. Tried to take out a loan to try and gamble it back on memecoins and lost it all in days. My parents still don't know and I have no idea how to pay any of this back.

* Turned 1k into 3.6k then lost at all. Then started with 3k and now I have only 1.5k. If I get back to 3k I will quit crypto forever.

* I invested money set aside for my childâ€™s college tuition into an altcoin, and the following week it was down 80% and the founder took his girlfriend to a 30k a night hotel. I am in agony.

* Started with 1500$ in 2022. Lost it all many times but kept depositing more irl money and eventually ran port to 700k during the AI meta. Secured profits, and done with crypto.

* Woke up this morning with 230k USD in my wallet, someone sent it to me by mistake. Not planning on sending it back.

* Round tripped $2.5m this cycle and now currently only have $40k onchain. Donâ€™t really know what to do or how to make it back.

# Using the above information, you should be able to understand the type of sentiments these "confessions" should be making. Pump fun is a launchpad for tokens on solana and its general eco system maintains a specific theme. The content/confessions being output should reference popular/flagship pump fun tokens including TROLL, BAGWORK, RETIRE, fartcoin, unstable coin, cupsey, CHILLHOUSE. Most confessions should be negative in it's tone but some should be very braggy.
